## What is it?

The client library for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io).

The idea is to instrument your application code and configure where the telemetry data is sent, e.g. to a file or a service of your choice. This is like always-on debugging and profiling that helps you to understand the runtime behavior of your systems and spot and fix correctness and performance problems.
